# Solar Challenge Week 0: Cross-Country Solar Farm Analysis

This repository contains the work for the 10 Academy Week 0 Challenge focusing on solar farm data analysis for Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

## Project Overview

The goal is to analyze solar radiation and environmental data to identify key trends and provide data-driven recommendations for high-potential regions for solar installation, supporting MoonLight Energy Solutions' strategic objectives.

## Environment Setup

To reproduce the development environment for this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/solar-challenge-week1.git
    cd solar-challenge-week1
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    We recommend using `venv` (Python's built-in virtual environment tool).

    *   Create the environment (e.g., named `venv`):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    *   Activate the environment:
        *   On Windows (Git Bash or Command Prompt):
            ```bash
            venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        *   On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **You are now ready to work on the project!**
    *   Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the `notebooks/` directory. Start JupyterLab with `jupyter lab`.
    *   Utility scripts will be placed in the `src/` directory.
